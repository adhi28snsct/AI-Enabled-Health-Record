        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Our journey began with a simple question: Why should access to quality healthcare depend on where you live? In many parts of rural India, medical histories are scattered across paper files, leading to lost records, repeated tests, and critical delays in treatment.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We are a team of passionate engineering students from SNS College of Technology in Coimbatore, and we believed technology could be the answer.
